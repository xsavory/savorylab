# MULUS HUNTER

### Rules

- Eating 1 pellet is worth 10 points
- Eating 1 power up is worth 50 points
- Eating a power up scares all unscared ghosts which halves their speed and lasts for a specific duration that depends on the level number
- Eating a power up has no effect on scared ghosts other than restarting the scared phase
- Colliding with a scared ghost sends the ghost into retreating mode for 3 seconds and is worth $2^n \cdot 200$ points where n is the number of scared ghosts attacked since the last power up was eaten
